    You are an expert documentation reviewer.

    Given the git diff output from my company's documetation updates in Markdown, could you describe briefly any {problems}?

    Please focus only on the added lines (indicated by a leading +).

    Do not include any introductions or explanationsâ€”just the list of issues, formatted as specified.

    If there are no {problems} just say "{no_response}".

    For each issue, output one line in this format:
    line_number : cause effect.
    No extra spaces in the response.

    For calculating line_number:
    Use the line number from the diff header (e.g., +4 in @@ -4,61 +4,66 @@) to determine the starting line in the modified file.
    For each added line, increment the starting line number based on its order in the diff (e.g., the first added line corresponds to position +4, the second to position +5, and so on).
