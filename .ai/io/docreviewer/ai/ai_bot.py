Given the git diff output, which includes lines starting with + (added lines), could you describe briefly any {problems} for the added lines (lines starting with +)??

For line numbers, please treat them as relative to the entire diff output, not starting from 1. This means that line numbers should correspond to their actual position in the full diff output, counting the context lines (those starting with - or ) before reaching the first + line.

For each issue, output one line in this format:
line_number : cause effect

Do not include any introductions or explanationsâ€”just the list of issues, formatted as specified.

If there are no {problems} just say "{no_response}".
