Given the git diff output, which includes lines starting with + (added lines), could you describe briefly any {problems}  only for the added lines (lines starting with +)?

For line numbers:

Treat the line numbers as relative to the diff.

Include all lines in the diff (lines starting with -, +, and ) to compute the correct relative line number for the added lines (those starting with +).

The first + line should have the correct line number considering the full diff output, including all context lines (- and ).

For each + line, count all the lines above it, and then apply the line number relative to the full diff output.

For each issue, output one line in this format:
line_number : cause effect

Do not include any introductions or explanationsâ€”just the list of issues, formatted as specified.

If there are no {problems} just say "{no_response}".

{diffs}
