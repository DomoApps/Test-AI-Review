Given the git diff output could you describe briefly any {problems} only for the added lines?

Start with the line number from the diff header, which specifies where the added lines begin in the original file (e.g., @@ -4,61 +4,66 @@).

For each issue, the correct line number should be calculated by considering the number of lines modified (added or removed).

For each issue, output one line in this format:
line_number : cause effect

Where:

line_number corresponds to the correct line number in the original file (calculated based on the starting line from the diff header).

cause effect describes the problem found in the line, e.g., "grammatical error - 'resource 's' should be 'resources'".

Do not include any introductions or explanationsâ€”just the list of issues, formatted as specified.

If there are no {problems} just say "{no_response}".

{diffs}
