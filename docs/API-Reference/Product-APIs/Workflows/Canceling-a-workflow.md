| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| instanceId    | String | Required | The id of the workflow instance. Note: this is not the model id, but the id generated when the workflow is started. |

> It is important to note that the instance id is not the model's id, but the id generated when the workflow is started. You will receive this from the api call to start a workflow or it will be available in the list of executions online.

#### Example

```json http
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://{instance}.domo.com/api/workflow/v1/instances/${instanceId}/cancel",
  "headers": {
    "X-DOMO-Developer-Token": "",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  }
}
```

#### HTTP Response

Returns the information about the instance of the Workflow that was just canceled. Note: The `status` property can take the values `null`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `CANCELED`, or `COMPLETED` and does not reflect the outcome of the cancel call. It takes a moment for the cancel to be processed and this is the status of the workflow at the time the request was sent.

A status of `null` might be valid. It just means the workflow hasnâ€™t reported back as started yet.
