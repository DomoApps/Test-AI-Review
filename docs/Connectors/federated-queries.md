# Federated Queries


<h3><strong>Make the most of your existing data strategy investments</strong></h3>
Domo’s federated data model allows you to use data from your existing data lakes and data warehouses without duplicating it in Domo, enabling faster implementation and lower maintenance and overhead costs. You can directly render cards and other user-level interactions in the Domo platform using a database hosted outside of Domo’s cloud. Use your firewalls to control all inbound and outbound traffic in-transit, and maintain control by defining the time to live for the cache and granting access only to approved database tables.

**Federated queries allow you to:**
<ul>
 	<li>Preserve existing data warehouse investment</li>
 	<li>Avoid data duplication and reduce data latency due to transfers</li>
 	<li>Control and protect data</li>
 	<li>Keep response times quick</li>
 	<li>Use Domo as a rapid prototyping data mart</li>
</ul>
