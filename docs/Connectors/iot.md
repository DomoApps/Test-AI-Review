<h3><strong>Turn connected devices into a new source of business intelligence</strong></h3>

 	<li>Sync data from your PLC Controllers directly to Domo using the OPC Plug-in through Workbench</li>
 	<li>Connect and combine all your data</li>
 	<li>Put data in your team’s hands</li>
 	<li>Write data from Domo back to your source systems</li>
 	<li>Use all your data to drive immediate action</li>
 	<li>Create business value from machine and device data, whether it’s from the shop floor or out in the field</li>
</ul>
