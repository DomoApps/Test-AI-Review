# Video Recording Guide

The Domo Appstore allows all apps published to have a short video presentation of the app on the app details page. These videos will help increase quality leads and provide customers with a better understanding of the apps in the Domo Appstore. By understanding the necessary steps for <strong>a) preparation, b) recording, c) submission, d) best practices</strong> you will be able to easily create valuable video presentations of your apps.

## Requirements
Before starting to record a video, it is important to understand the requirements. Make sure the following is in order before starting:
<ul>
 	<li>Download a screen recording software (ScreenFlow, Camtasia, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Make sure you have a microphone</li>
 	<li>Videos must be in a .mp4 format</li>
 	<li>Videos must be 55 seconds long</li>
</ul>

## Preparation
The preparation stage is the most crucial stage and will really determine the success of the video. The following best practices will help layout all the material needed to create a professional video.

<strong>App Overview</strong>

The app overview meeting will help answer key questions that are key to helping customer understand if the app is right for them and how they can best use it to answer relevant business questions. The following are lists of questions that should be answered before writing a script:
<ul>
 	<li>What is the business questions that this app is designed to solve?</li>
 	<li>Who is the target audience of the video? (i.e. sales leader vs. sales rep)</li>
 	<li>Which parts of the app contribute the most to answering the business question?</li>
 	<li>What datasets or demonstration resources do you need to have ready to use or show?</li>
 	<li>Who will draft an outline and script in the provided storyboard template?</li>
 	<li>Who will record the screencast and audio for the video?</li>
 	<li>What are your deadlines? When do you need this video to go live?</li>
 	<li>After answering these questions, it is time to create a storyboard.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Storyboarding</strong>

Creating a storyboard helps you describe each visual effectively while recording. See the example below:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2619" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/development.domo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/08141020/Screen-Shot-2016-08-05-at-10.11.21-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-05 at 10.11.21 AM" width="705" height="790" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2620" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/development.domo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/08141126/Screen-Shot-2016-08-05-at-10.13.22-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-05 at 10.13.22 AM" width="705" height="231" />
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">NOTE: due to the nature of these videos, it is very important to use sales-oriented, marketing language. Please review your script before continuing. Once you are satisfied with the language and approach of your script, proceed to <b>Recording</b>.</span></p>

## Recording
The video recording should run very smooth if the previous preparation steps were followed correctly. Follow these next steps to start recording.
<ul>
 	<li>Step 1: Create a screenshot or icon of your app to be the cover photo for your video. You will either add this to the template yourself or send it with video fill to Domo to compile.</li>
 	<li>Step 2: Create the 55-second app showcase video. We recommend completing the audio portion first and then using the finalized audio to record the visual presentation of the app. Then compile the audio and visual recordings into one video using video editing software (ScreenFlow, Camtasia, etc).</li>
 	<li>Step 3: Add the video to the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/development.domo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/16114731/New-Appstore-Template.aep_.zip"> Adobe After Effects Template</a> and follow the template instructional video below.</li>
 	<li>Step 4: Export file using the H.264 format to produce an .mp4</li>
</ul>

## Adding to your App Submission
Once you have finished recording your video you will need to upload it to YouTube. You can then add the link to your video in your submission in the Add Media step.

## Best Practices
<h3><strong>Best Practices</strong></h3>
In this section, we provide some of the best practices for recording your app.

<strong>Pre-recording</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Make your demo window full screen, which also includes putting the top and bottom menu bars in hide mode if they aren’t already.</li>
 	<li>Turn off all notifications on your phone and laptop so everything is silent during the recording.</li>
 	<li>If you’re reading from a script, set it up so that you don’t have to turn your head away from the microphone to read it.</li>
 	<li>We strongly encourage including the following in all videos:
<ul>
 	<li><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s1">A hook/quick explanation of the problem</span></li>
 	<li>“Salesy” and compelling language aimed to get the viewer excited about buying your app</li>
 	<li>Talk about things that can easily correspond to what is going on the screen to avoid dead time in the video</li>
 	<li>Restating the problem at the end</li>
 	<li>Ending with a call to action (e.g. "Go to the Domo Appstore and try this app today!")</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>Recording</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Avoid “talking with your mouse,” which means you avoid moving your mouse unless you’re pointing to something specifically on the screen or clicking on something.</li>
 	<li>Make sure your mouth is always facing the microphone and that you keep the same relative distance from the microphone throughout the recording.</li>
 	<li>If possible, memorize your script or speak as though you were actually talking to somebody. Avoid using a “reading voice” when speaking.</li>
 	<li>Sit very still when recording audio so there is no sound from any shifting in the chair, brushing arms across the desk, etc.</li>
 	<li>Try to smile while talking so you will sound happy and upbeat, and be sure to use inflection and clear enunciation in your voice.</li>
</ul>
