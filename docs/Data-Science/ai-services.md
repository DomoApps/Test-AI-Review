# AI Services

Domo’s AI Service Layer makes it easy for users to manage, deploy, and optimize AI and ML models—including Large Language Models (LLMs)—so they can get the most out of their data experiences. Its capabilities span from generative AI and natural language processing that enable text generation and SQL queries, to audio transcription and text translation. 

Most importantly, the framework lets customers and partners host and manage their own models and solutions in our data experience platform.
